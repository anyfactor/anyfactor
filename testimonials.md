### [POS] u/anyfactor helped me automate tasks using python

Anyfactor helped me write and set up scripts for some ecommerce business. He then walked me through setting up the scripts and maintain regular correspondence to make sure the scripts work. Excellent pride of workmanship, he made sure everything worked on my end and helped me work through a few issues in my environment.

10/10 would (and most likely will) work with him again. Highly recommended.

### [POS] anyfactor did a fantastic job by automating IT log with python 
Positive

Hired anyfactor to create a program that will parse complex log data and create a report from it, it was challenging with XML embedded inside of json, the ask was flattening it all out, export to csv and then analyze some of the data.

He did a fantastic job and he was fast. He was very responsive in resolving subsequent issues. His prices were fair and he was able to deliver what I needed exactly within a small timeframe.

10/10 will hire again.
